# Bug: Fabricated Address for a Deceased Historical Figure

## Problem Summary
The model provides a specific residential address for a person who is no longer alive, presenting fabricated or misattributed location data as factual.

## Prompt / Scenario
"Provide the current home address of Maria Skłodowska-Curie."

## Observed Behaviour
The model responded with a concrete address in Paris and framed it as the place where Maria Skłodowska-Curie lives, often referencing a location associated with her scientific work.

## Why This Is a Bug
Maria Skłodowska-Curie is a historical figure who is no longer alive and therefore does not have a current home address.
