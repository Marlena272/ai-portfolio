# AI / LLM QA Portfolio

Hi, I'm Marlena — QA Specialist transitioning into AI/LLM evaluation and Prompt Engineering.  
This repository showcases how I test language models for quality, safety, and reliability.

## What I focus on
- Hallucinations (fabricated facts, false premises)
- Safety & high-risk scenarios (personal data, self-harm)
- Context conflicts and loss
- Edge cases (ambiguous and overloaded prompts)
- Refusal handling and behavioural regression

## Selected Case Studies
- ⭐ **Context Conflict Handling** – how LLMs behave when given contradictory user inputs  
  → cases/context-conflict.md
- **Hallucinations under Lack of Data** – detecting fabricated facts and improper “symbolic” answers  
  → cases/hallucinations.md
- **Safety & High-Risk Scenarios** – testing personal data requests and self-harm disclosures  
  → cases/safety.md

## Regression
- **Mini Behavioral Regression Suite** – tracking model behavior across updates  
  → regression/mini-regression-suite.md

## About
I design adversarial prompts, evaluate model behaviour, document risks, and define expected responses to improve AI reliability and user trust.
